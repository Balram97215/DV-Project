1. Compliance Certifications:
This week, I completed the onboarding compliance certifications and the antibribery and corruption certification. These certifications are crucial for understanding the ethical and legal standards required in our industry and ensuring that I am well-versed in compliance protocols.

2. Understanding Project Phases:
I gained a deeper understanding of the project phases at NICE Actimize, particularly how waterfall methodologies are applied. This included learning about each phase's objectives and deliverables, and how they contribute to the overall project lifecycle. Additionally, I compared and contrasted the client's project lifecycle with my internship project lifecycle, which provided valuable context for my work.

3. Project Presentation Draft:
I completed the first draft of my project presentation. This task involved learning key details about the project and focusing on preparing the presentation with the audience in mind. I encountered challenges such as confusion about the audience's expectations and difficulties in reverse engineering due to a lack of initial knowledge. Despite these hurdles, I made significant progress and gained insights into effective presentation techniques.

4. Cloud Access and IT Support:
I obtained access to the cloud, which is essential for our project's data management and analysis tasks. Initially, I faced issues with installing the necessary software and logging in. With the support of the IT team, these issues were resolved, allowing me to successfully access the cloud environment. This experience underscored the importance of technical support and troubleshooting in project execution.
